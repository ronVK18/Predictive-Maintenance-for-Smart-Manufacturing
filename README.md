## 🚀 Core Features

### 🔧 Predictive Maintenance System
- Uses **LSTM machine learning models** to detect faults in machinery based on live sensor data.
- Automatic **anomaly detection** and **failure forecasting**.
- Helps minimize costly machine downtime and unplanned maintenance.

### 🖥️ Web (Super Admin Panel)
- Super Admin can:
  - Monitor all factory activities from a **central dashboard**.
  - Add/remove machines via the **machine database**.
  - Assign scheduled maintenance with the **maintenance scheduler**.
  - View historical performance trends with the **RAG (Red-Amber-Green) system**.

### 📱 Mobile App (Admin & Worker)
#### 👨‍💼 Admin:
- View live **factory layout on map**.
- Receive real-time **fault alerts** detected via ML.
- Allocate workers to pending tasks.
- Explore machines in 3D using **AR visualizations**.
- Generate and download **PDF reports**.
- Manage notifications and task completion statuses.

#### 👷 Worker:
- Receive assigned maintenance tasks via push **notifications**.
- Upload images of faulty machines using **Image Uploader**.
- Mark tasks as completed with **one-tap status update**.
- Auto-generate **maintenance report summaries** in PDF.
- Report unidentified issues manually through the app.
